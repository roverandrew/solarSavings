  Calculate the cost-feasibility of solar panels roofs in Canada.
</p>

## Introduction
<p>For mass-adoption of renewable energy sources to occur, they must be economically competitive with non-renewable alternatives. SolarSavings therefore looks to answer the question "Are solar roofs worth it?". Using the inputted data above and geolocation specific data on solar irradiance, cost of electricity and more, SolarSavings calculates and visualizes the economic viability of Tesla's yet-to-be-released solar shingle roof.</p>

## Inputs

<h3>Roof Type</h3>

These are the different types of "normal" roofs, that the solar panel roof will be compared to.
- The "slate" roof choice represents a roof that costs $242CAD/m^2.<br>
- The "tile" roof choice represents a roof that costs $169CAD/m^2.<br>
- The "asphalt" roof choice represents a roof that costs $93CAD/m^2.<br>
    
    Average roofing costs were derived from data available on Home Advisor and Homewyse. In each case, there is a wide range of roofing costs, for each roof type     it's respective midpoint cost is used. Ranges for roof tile types from Home Advisor were derived using information from roofing contractors that included all     equivalent components of a Solar Roof (such as installation labor, materials, existing roof tear-off, and underlayment).
    
<h3>Monthly Electricity Bill</h3>

<p>Used in combination with the kWh cost of electricity in the user's respective province to calculate the annual kWh energy output of a household.</p>
<p>Formula: kWh Electricity Consumed = ( Monthly Electricity Bill / kWh Electricity Cost ) x 12</p>
